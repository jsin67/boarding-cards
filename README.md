I have used following tech-stack to develop this application

- [x] MVVM: Used MVVM with ViewModel and LiveData.
- [x] Kotlin: Used Kotlin for business, view, and test cases 100%. 
- [x] Dagger : Dependency injector. 
- [x] TDD/Mockito : Tested ViewModel since it is handling local logic for sorting models. Used mockito to mock the repository.The code coverage for ViewModel is 90%.
 

Note: If I had more time I could have done the better job in UI.
